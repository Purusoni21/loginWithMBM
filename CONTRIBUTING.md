## How to contribute to loginWithMBM

Everyone reading this thanks for showing your interest in this project. Volunteers who would like to work on 
this project, any bug report or any suggestions are more than welcome.

Make sure your requests follow our [Code of conduct](https://github.com/minal6066/loginWithMBM/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to loginWithMBM](https://github.com/minal6066/loginWithMBM/pulls)
with a clear list of what you've done. 
Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
  * We avoid logic in views, putting HTML generators into helpers
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.
